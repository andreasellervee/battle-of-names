## Improvements vol 8

Implement more spawn modes! (Add description as tooltip for the selection)
- Random - (Default) All contenders spawn in random positions inside the arena.
- Even Spread - Fighters spawn evenly spaced around a circle.
- Clustered Teams - Fighters spawn in small clusters (2–3 names per side).
- Center Drop - All fighters spawn near the middle. The circle starts shrinking immediately.
- Storm Spawn - Everyone spawns outside the safe zone and must rush in.

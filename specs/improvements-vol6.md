## Improvements vol 6

Better understanding of who is who!

💡 1. Label Styling (Above Each Blob)

Display each fighter’s name floating above the blob, clearly tied to it.

Recommended Style:
- Font: Cinzel (Regular or SemiBold for readability)
- Size: 14–18px (scales with zoom)
- Color: lightened version of the blob’s hue
- Outline: 1–2px semi-transparent dark stroke
- Glow: faint gold or colored glow for magic vibe

🌀 2. Dynamic Linking (Blob ↔ Label)

Help the player’s eyes connect the label with the fighter.

Options:
- Draw a thin magical tether line from the blob top to the label.
- Slightly curved, matching the blob’s hue.
- Low opacity for subtlety.

🧭 3. Arena Name List (Left Panel)

Use the left panel as a scoreboard, not just an input list.

Enhancements:
- Show each fighter’s color (tiny circle, gem, or axe icon)
- Pulse or glow when they deal or take damage
- Fade or strike-through when eliminated

🧱 4. Avoiding Label Overlap

When blobs cluster close together:

Techniques:
- Apply a small force-based separation on labels
- Stack vertically (slight Y offsets) if overlapping
- Fade labels (opacity 0.4) when inside shrinking circle for clarity

⚡ 5. Fantasy Flair Ideas

Make it match the “Battle of Names” aesthetic.

Options:
- Scroll banners under names
- Faded parchment texture: #FCE9B0 → #F5D88E
- 50% opacity, gold border
- Crest icons beside the name
- Tiny rune, axe, or helmet matching blob color
- Elimination effect
- Name fades → leaves glowing rune mark in its place

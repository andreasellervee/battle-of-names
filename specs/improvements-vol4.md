- Name update: Battle of Names
- Name font: Cinzel Decorative
- Style upgrade:
  - “Fantasy Arena” (Dark but lively)
    - Background: deep purple gradient (#2E003E → #4B0082)
    - Fighters: contrasting “gem” colors
    - Emerald (#00C896)
    - Ruby (#FF3864)
    - Sapphire (#007BFF)

    - Use gold or white for UI highlights, and darker borders for contrast.
    - Add thin glowing borders on buttons (use gold, cyan, or violet glows).
    - Use drop shadows under text for legibility against magical backgrounds.
    - The “Start Battle” button could have a gem-like gradient (e.g., #D38312 → #A83279) with a hover glow.

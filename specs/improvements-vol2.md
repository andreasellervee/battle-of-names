## Improvements vol 2

- Overall design wise, think of the game Fall guys. It's a very fun, colorful game
- If someone dies, make them gray and semi-transparent, so they would visually "get out of the way"
  - Also make their z-index be lower, so they would disappear more into the background
- When a collision happens, add a splash
- Up the tempo a bit more
- Add some intelligence to the movement, make them try to dodge others (and potentially go off the playing area)
- They need to hold axes (viking style)

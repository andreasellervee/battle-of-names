## Improvements vol 1

- Make the health icons red hearts. If player gets hit, then cross out one heart
- Tempo is a bit slow, make it faster.
- Collision needs some animation and some feedback. 
  - When collision happens, make the blobs bounce backwards to separate the fighters
  - When collision happens, then add a small "explosion" or "splash" to indicate a collision
- Introduce possibility to select spawn points:
  - Add a dropdown selector under "Start Battle" with currently 1 option - "Random"
  - Randomly place the players into the playing field, but make space between them
